	<p class="about-desc">Hi! My name is Mac Hayter. I have just recently finished my third year of computer science student at the University of Ottawa. I have a passion to explore and learn new topics within my field of study and am always willing to take on a new challenge.
	I enjoy being involved in intermurals and with the Computer Scirence Student Association at the University of Ottawa. I have been lucky enough to have had the opprotunity to be involved with my schools student association over the last year as the VP Executive Affairs of the Computer Science Student Association. Throughout the year I participated in weekly meetings presenting any updates in regards to current responsibilities. Throughout these meetings I assisted in planning, organising and running various events with the association. 
	I look forward to the next opprotunity I have and am excited to learn all that it has to teach me.
